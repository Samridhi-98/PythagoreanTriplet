# PythagoreanTriplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

`a**2 + b**2 = c**2`

and such that,

a < b < c

For example,

`3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2`.

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which a + b + c = N.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000: {200, 375, 425}.
